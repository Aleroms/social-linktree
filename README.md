# Social Linktree
Developed a shareable linktree application using **Vue.js**, **TypeScript**, and AWS services (**Amplify**, **Cognito**, **API Gateway**, **Lambda**) for the backend, implementing secure Authentication/Authorization with **AWS Cognito** and efficient data storage with **DynamoDB**.

## Introduction
After receiving AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification (CLF-C02) I wanted to have more practice with the services since the cloud practitioner certification is more theory. Having both theory and practice would develop me as a better Cloud Engineer.

## Post Mortem
My main intention was to learn key services offered by AWS. I feel that AWS Amplify is a great tool but for learning cloud architecture, allocating the resources manually would be more suitable.
